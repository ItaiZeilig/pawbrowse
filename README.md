PawBrowse is a **Chrome MV3 extension + a tiny zero-dependency MCP server** that lets your local
AI coding agent (like **Claude Code**) read and act on your **actual, logged-in browser tabs** —
your profile, your sessions, your open pages — with **no remote-debug port, no browser relaunch,
and no separate AI model or API key.**

It's the open, self-owned answer to "I wish my agent could just use my real browser": the same
capability as the first-party Claude-in-Chrome extension, but **yours, auditable, MCP-native, and
faster per action** (see the [benchmark](#benchmark) below).

```
Claude Code ──stdio (MCP)──▶ mcp/server.mjs ─┐
Cursor      ──stdio (MCP)──▶ mcp/server.mjs ─┼─IPC─▶ broker ──ws://127.0.0.1:10577──▶ Chrome extension ──CDP──▶ your real tabs
VS Code     ──stdio (MCP)──▶ mcp/server.mjs ─┘                                              │
                                                                    each session ⇒ its own 🐾 tab group
```

**Run as many sessions as you want.** The first one starts a shared *broker* that owns the port
and the extension; every other session just connects to it. Each session gets its **own tab group**
(named `🐾 PawBrowse`, its own color) and drives only its own tab, so several editors/agents can
automate the browser at once without fighting over a port or a tab. Close a session and its tabs are
cleaned up; the broker reaps itself when the last session ends. Nothing to configure — no ports, no
"already in use."

## Getting started

Two one-time steps, about 30 seconds. PawBrowse is a **Chrome extension** (the hands + eyes in
your browser) plus a tiny **local server** your AI client runs — both install with a click.

### 1 — Add the extension to Chrome

[![Add to Chrome](https://img.shields.io/badge/Add%20to-Chrome-4285F4?logo=googlechrome&logoColor=white&style=for-the-badge)](https://chromewebstore.google.com/detail/ppfdoledneneiaflggcfogecfnhkmloe)

> Live on the **[Chrome Web Store](https://chromewebstore.google.com/detail/ppfdoledneneiaflggcfogecfnhkmloe)** — one click, done.

### 2 — Connect your AI client (one time)

<p>
<a href="cursor://anysphere.cursor-deeplink/mcp/install?name=pawbrowse&config=eyJjb21tYW5kIjoibnB4IiwiYXJncyI6WyIteSIsInBhd2Jyb3dzZUBsYXRlc3QiXX0="><img src="https://img.shields.io/badge/Add%20to-Cursor-000000?logo=cursor&logoColor=white&style=for-the-badge" alt="Add to Cursor"></a>
<a href="https://insiders.vscode.dev/redirect/mcp/install?name=pawbrowse&config=%7B%22command%22%3A%22npx%22%2C%22args%22%3A%5B%22-y%22%2C%22pawbrowse%40latest%22%5D%7D"><img src="https://img.shields.io/badge/Install%20in-VS%20Code-007ACC?logo=visualstudiocode&logoColor=white&style=for-the-badge" alt="Install in VS Code"></a>
<a href="https://github.com/ItaiZeilig/pawbrowse/raw/main/dist/pawbrowse.mcpb"><img src="https://img.shields.io/badge/Add%20to-Claude%20Desktop-D97757?logo=anthropic&logoColor=white&style=for-the-badge" alt="Add to Claude Desktop"></a>
</p>

**Claude Desktop** — click the button above to download `pawbrowse.mcpb`, then **double-click it**
(or drag it into **Settings → Extensions**) and click **Install**. No command, no config.

**Claude Code** — one line (the CLI has no click-to-install, so paste this):

```bash
claude mcp add --scope user pawbrowse -- npx -y pawbrowse@latest
```

Then **fully restart your client** and ask: *"use pawbrowse: what's my browser status?"* — you
should see `extension_connected: true`, and the extension badge turns **green ●**.

> Needs **Node.js ≥ 18**. Works with Claude Code, Cursor, VS Code, or any MCP client — the one
> button/line just tells your client to run `npx -y pawbrowse@latest`; nothing to clone or build.

> Building from source or contributing? See **[CONTRIBUTING.md](CONTRIBUTING.md)**.

## Using it

You don't call the tools yourself — you just **ask Claude Code in plain language**, and it uses
PawBrowse to drive whatever tab you point it at. Some things to try:

- *"Open news.ycombinator.com and give me the top 5 story titles."*
- *"On this tab, search for 'open source license' and open the first result."*
- *"Fill the signup form on the current page with my name and email, but don't submit."*
- *"Go to my GitHub notifications and tell me what's new."*

Tips:
- It acts on the **tab you have open and are logged into** — no separate window, no re-login.
- Point it at a specific tab by name, or it uses the active tab.
- It reads the page as a list of controls and clicks/types precisely — no screenshots needed.

## Troubleshooting

| Symptom | Fix |
| --- | --- |
| Badge never turns green | The server isn't running — make sure you **fully restarted** Claude Code after `claude mcp add` (a `/mcp` reconnect alone won't relaunch it). |
| "No extension connected" | Reload the extension at `chrome://extensions`, then re-run `browser_status`. |
| "Another debugger is already attached" | That tab has DevTools open or another extension driving it — close DevTools or switch tabs. |
| A `chrome://` / Web Store page won't drive | Those are browser pages Chrome blocks from automation — use a normal web page. |
| Changed the port | Set the same port in the extension's **Options** and in `--env PAWBROWSE_PORT=…`. |

> Requires **Node ≥ 18** (≥ 22 to run the test suite). Works on Chrome, Edge, and Brave.

---

## Highlights

- **Your real browser.** Uses Chrome's built-in `chrome.debugger` (CDP) on tabs you already have
  open and logged into — no `--remote-debugging-port`, no relaunch, no separate profile.
- **The agent is the policy.** No second model, no `TYPESAFE_API_KEY`, no OpenRouter — *you*
  (Claude) decide every action. Page content flows to your agent as normal tool results and
  **never leaves for any third-party server.**
- **Reads pages as an element table, not screenshots.** A compact, numbered list of the actionable
  controls in view — cheap in tokens, fast to reason over, precise to act on.
- **Fast.** Stable element refs let it act in one round trip, not two — **~2× fewer agent round-trips**
  than perceive-then-act drivers (see the [benchmark](#benchmark)).
- **Zero dependencies, MIT, extensible.** The whole server is one auditable `.mjs` file; the
  extension is plain JS. Add a tool or an op in minutes.

## Benchmark

<p align="center">
  <a href="assets/benchmark.mp4"><img src="assets/benchmark.gif" alt="Side-by-side benchmark on live Booking.com: the same agent books a 4-star Lisbon hotel through PawBrowse in 5 agent round-trips and through Claude in Chrome in 10, so PawBrowse finishes the task while Claude in Chrome is halfway" width="100%"></a>
</p>

<p align="center"><sub>
Same task on live Booking.com (book a 4-star Lisbon hotel — 5 actions), same agent (Claude), same real Chrome, both filmed live.
The clock counts <strong>agent round-trips</strong>: one tool call = one round-trip, priced at the same per-call latency for both. <a href="assets/benchmark.mp4">MP4</a>
</sub></p>

| | PawBrowse | Claude in Chrome |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Round-trips for the 5 actions | **5** — 1 per action | 10 — 2 per action (read, then act) |
| Screenshots / reads to see the page | **0** — every act returns the fresh element table | 5 — one before each action |
| Relative agent time | **1×** | ~2× |

> **Why:** the agent loop is round-trip-bound — each tool call is a full model inference. PawBrowse's
> `act` returns the next screen already perceived, so an action is **one** round-trip; Claude in Chrome
> must perceive-then-act, so every action is **two**. Same task, same model, so the per-call latency is
> the same on both sides and the **round-trip count is the gap**: 5 vs 10 → ~2×.
>
> **Honest caveats:** the clock is round-trips × a fixed per-call latency (equal for both), not a
> stopwatch — it isolates the structural difference and drops network/page-load noise. One run each;
> an illustration, not a statistic. Reproduce: `scripts/demo/peek-record.mjs` films each tab,
> `scripts/demo/render_race.py` renders the comparison.

## How it compares

| | Claude-in-Chrome | **PawBrowse** |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Drives your real, logged-in Chrome | ✅ | ✅ (`chrome.debugger`, no port) |
| Decision model | Claude | **Claude — no second model, no key** |
| Perception | screenshots + a11y tree | **compact element table** |
| Round trips per action | 2 (perceive → act) | **1** (stable refs) |
| Page data to a third party | no | **no** |
| Per-site permission gate | yes (allowlist) | no |
| Open source / self-owned | ❌ | **✅ MIT, zero-dep** |
| Works with any MCP client | ❌ | **✅** |

## The element table

Every observation returns a compact, numbered table of the **in-viewport, actionable** controls —
with proper accessible names, current values, and state flags — instead of a screenshot:

```
Web browser - Wikipedia  —  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Web_browser
scroll 0/6361  ·  83 controls
e2   fill    "Search Wikipedia"
e6   click   "Log in"
e10  click   "2 History"
e13  click ▾ "Toggle Browser market subsection"
e9   click✓  "Remember me"
e3   select  "Country"  opts{US | UK | ...}
```

Flags after the kind: `✓`/`·` checked/unchecked · `▾`/`▸` expanded/collapsed (open vs closed menu,
combobox, accordion) · `◉` selected (active tab/option). Refs like `e10` derive from a **stable node
identity**, so the agent can act on a control by ref in **one round trip**.

## Tools

| Tool | Purpose |
| --- | --- |
| `browser_status` | Connection + attached-tab diagnostics. Call first if anything's off. |
| `browser_tabs` | List open tabs (`id`, `title`, `url`, `active`). |
| `browser_navigate` | `{ url, tabId? }` → element table after load. |
| `browser_observe` | `{ tabId? }` → the element table. |
| `browser_read` | `{ tabId?, max_chars? }` → the page's readable prose (articles, docs, rules). |
| `browser_act` | `{ ops: [...], tabId? }` → runs ops in order, returns a fresh table + a "page changed?" signal. |
| `browser_assert` | `{ contains? \| url_includes? \| ref_visible?, tabId? }` → prove an outcome (pass/fail). |

**Ops for `browser_act`:** `{op:"click",ref:"e12"}` · `{op:"click_text",text:"..."}` (for custom
widgets/menus not in the table) · `{op:"type",ref:"e7",text:"..."}` · `{op:"select",ref:"e8",value:"..."}`
· `{op:"key",key:"Enter"}` · `{op:"scroll",dy:600}` · `{op:"wait",ms:500}`.

## Reliability & safety engineering

PawBrowse was hardened through two multi-agent code audits **and** live testing on real sites:

- **Hit-tested clicks.** Before every click it re-resolves the element live and verifies the center
  isn't covered (`elementFromPoint`), so it never clicks a stale, moved, or occluded target.
- **Semantic freshness guard.** An element's role + accessible name is fingerprinted at observe time
  and re-checked before acting — a silently relabeled target is rejected ("observe again") instead
  of mis-clicked.
- **Robust fill.** Select-all + `insertText`, which works with React/controlled inputs; typed
  comboboxes wait for their autocomplete options to actually render.
- **Background-tab safe.** Uses `Emulation.setFocusEmulationEnabled` and `setTimeout`-based waits
  (never `requestAnimationFrame`, which Chrome pauses in background tabs) so driving a tab you aren't
  looking at doesn't hang.
- **No double-execution.** If a post-action read fails because the page is navigating, the ops are
  reported as executed ("call observe next") rather than surfaced as a failure to retry.
- **Serialized, unwedgeable command queue** — overlapping calls can't race the debugger, and one
  hung command can't block the rest.

## Security & privacy

- **No data leaves your machine.** There's no model and no API key; page content goes only to the
  agent you run locally. `password`, `file`, and `hidden` inputs are excluded and never exposed.
  (Other visible fields — e.g. text inputs — *are* part of the element table, so treat what's on
  screen as visible to your agent.)
- **Local-only bridge.** The WebSocket binds to `127.0.0.1`, rejects non-`chrome-extension://`
  origins (so a web page can't connect), trusts only the current extension socket, caps inbound
  frame size, and rejects malformed/oversized frames. **Trust model:** the bridge trusts any
  *local* process on `127.0.0.1` (there's no shared token yet), so it assumes other software on
  your machine is trusted — the same assumption as most localhost dev tools. A per-pair token is
  planned hardening.
- **One powerful permission, no host permissions.** The extension declares `debugger` (plus `tabs`,
  `storage`, `alarms`) and **no** host permissions — `chrome.debugger` doesn't need them. That's the
  same capability class as any real-browser agent; use it deliberately.
- **Fully auditable.** The server is one zero-dependency file; the extension is plain JS.

## Privacy policy

PawBrowse is built to collect nothing. Full policy: **[PRIVACY.md](PRIVACY.md)**. In short:

- **Collection / use:** PawBrowse has no AI model, no account, no API key, and **no telemetry or
  analytics**. Page content it reads (element tables, page text) is returned only to the local AI
  client you run, to fulfill your request.
- **Storage:** the only thing stored is your **bridge port number**, in `chrome.storage.local` on
  your machine. Page content is not persisted by the extension beyond the current operation.
- **Sharing:** nothing is sent to the developer or any third-party server. All traffic stays on
  `127.0.0.1` (localhost) between the extension and the server on your own computer.
- **Retention:** none — there is no server-side data, so there is nothing to retain or delete.
- **Contact:** questions or requests via [GitHub issues](https://github.com/ItaiZeilig/pawbrowse/issues).

## Notes & limits

- Attaching shows Chrome's "PawBrowse is debugging this browser" banner — expected.
- One debugger client per tab: a tab with DevTools open (or driven by another extension) can't be
  attached — switch tabs or close DevTools.
- `chrome://`, the Chrome Web Store, and other browser pages can't be driven.
- **One active client at a time.** The bridge is a single localhost port, so PawBrowse can be driven
  by one client at a time (e.g. Claude Code *or* Claude Desktop). A second client reports the port
  is in use via `browser_status` rather than failing hard; set a different `PAWBROWSE_PORT` per
  client if you need both.
- **Shadow DOM and same-origin iframes are enumerated** (v0.4.0): controls inside open shadow roots
  (web components) and same-origin iframes appear in the element table and are clickable/typable by
  ref. **Not yet:** cross-origin iframes (the browser blocks JS access to them), canvas, and file
  uploads.
